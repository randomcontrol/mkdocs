# Target Object

## Summary

The YouTube video tutorial introduces a new "target object" feature in Maverick Render software. This object allows users to change the pivot point of other objects, enabling functionalities like orbiting and radial array cloning. The tutorial demonstrates its use in creating turntable animations, showing how the rotation center remains fixed on the target object regardless of its position. This feature provides enhanced flexibility for complex animations, particularly beneficial for tasks such as jewelry rendering. The video concludes with an invitation to viewers to experiment with the new tool.

## F.A.Q.

- **What is the Target Object in Maverick Render?**
The Target Object is a new type of object introduced in Maverick Render. It acts as a customizable pivot point that can be used to control the movement and rotation of other objects within the scene. You can create it using a toolbar button in the Objects panel.

- **How Can the Target Object Be Used to Modify an Object's Pivot Point?**
You can use the "Copy Pivot From" option in the move tool panel to transfer the Target Object's pivot to another object or assembly. By selecting the target object in the dialog that pops up, the selected object will now move or rotate around the target's position. This means the object's movement can now be relative to the target.

- **What is an Example of How to Use the Modified Pivot Point?**
Once an object's pivot is modified to match a target object, you can perform transformations like rotating with the shift key pressed to create radial arrays or clones around the target point. This allows for intricate and precise geometric configurations.

- **How Does the Target Object Work with Turntable Animations?**
The Target Object can be used to define the center of rotation for turntable animations. In the turntable pivot options, you select "selected object" and choose the target object. The turntable will then rotate around the target, allowing you to easily control and adjust the rotation point.

- **Why is Using a Target Object for Turntable Animations Useful?**
Using a target object for turntable animations is advantageous because you can move the target object and the turntable rotation center will follow it. This makes it easier to achieve specific rotation centers, especially when rendering objects like jewelry or items that require precise rotational movements around a particular point.

- **Can I Adjust the Position of the Turntable Rotation After Setting the Target Object?**
Yes, after setting the Target Object as the pivot for your turntable animation, you can move the target. The turntable will continue to rotate around the new location of the target. This adds flexibility and control over the positioning and animation of the turntable rotation.

- **Does Using a Target Object Affect the Actual Geometry of Objects?**
No, the Target Object only affects an object's pivot point and therefore its movement and rotation within the scene. It does not modify the geometry of the object itself.

- **What is the Main Advantage of Using a Target Object in Maverick Render?**
The main advantage is flexibility and precision in defining the center of rotation for objects and animations, including turntable rotations. This is especially helpful when aiming for specific configurations or precise animation patterns.
