# Objects Introduction

## Summary

This YouTube tutorial video demonstrates the Maverick Render software's user interface, focusing on the Objects and Object Library panels. The tutorial covers object manipulation tools like moving, rotating, scaling, and grouping, explaining keyboard shortcuts and functionalities such as axis locking and pivot relocation. It also details the Object Library's various tabs—Basic, Primitives, Rooms, and Favorites—showing how to utilize pre-made assets like bases, primitives, and rooms for scene creation and product visualization. The video further explores the use of ambiences and floors for lighting and shadow control. Finally, it emphasizes the ease of use and drag-and-drop features for efficient workflow.

## F.A.Q.

- **How do I control object visibility in Maverick Render?**
You can control object visibility using three icons in the Objects panel. The first, a lock icon, prevents accidental transformations and material assignments. The second, a full visibility icon (eye symbol), toggles the object's visibility in the viewport, hiding or showing it. The third, a "visible to camera" icon (camera with an eye symbol), makes the object invisible to the camera but it will still cast shadows, which is useful for some special effects.

- **What is the Move Tool and how does it work?**
The Move tool allows for the transformation of objects using a 3D gizmo in the viewport. You can translate (move), rotate, and scale objects. The Move tool has a floating panel that synchronizes with the 3D gizmo providing granular controls including locking transformations to specific axes or planes, and setting the rotation step size. Shortcuts such as W for translate, E for rotate and R for scale help to speed up workflow.

- **How do I create and use object groups?**
To create a group, multi-select the desired objects, then either click the "Create group" icon or right-click the selection and select "group". Once grouped, enable group selection mode in the toolbar to select and transform the entire group as a single entity using the Move tool. Grouping objects simplifies scene management and object manipulation.

- **How can I easily align objects in my scene?**
The Move tool allows you to relocate the pivot point of an object to the top, center, or bottom. This, coupled with the "snap to pivot" option allows you to align objects to target surfaces. For example, by moving the pivot of an object to its base and then snapping it to a surface, you can quickly align an object that is floating above a surface.

- **What is the Object Library panel and what can I find there?**
The Object Library panel contains pre-made elements, organized into tabs, that can be easily integrated into your scene using drag-and-drop. These elements include basic shapes like cubes and spheres, pedestals for object presentation, pre-made rooms for scene setups, and floors that interact with lighting and reflections.

- **How do the rooms in the object library work?**
Rooms from the Object Library are pre-designed environments that are easily integrated into your scene via drag-and-drop. When dragged in, Maverick intelligently repositions and resizes the room to fit the size of your object. Rooms are a quick way to set up a scene for product visualization or rendering.

- **How do floors in the object library function?**
Floors from the Object Library are designed to automatically catch shadows and reflections within the scene. Maverick allows you to swap floors to change the look of a scene. Some floors might use ambient occlusion to affect scene lighting. Floors are easily integrated via drag-and-drop and can be swapped in and out to affect the lighting of your scene.

- **What are the "favorites" tab in the Objects Library and how do I use it?**
The favorites tab allows you to collect and save objects that you use frequently. You can tag objects by selecting them in the library. The favorites tab makes it easier to find objects you use regularly when building scenes in Maverick Render.
