# Lock Selection

## Summary

This YouTube video tutorial introduces a new "lock selection" feature in Maverick Render software. This feature prevents accidental deselection, particularly useful when manipulating small or overlapping objects like lights within the ambience composer. By locking the selection, users can easily move objects without repeatedly re-selecting them. The tutorial demonstrates this functionality using spotlights, showcasing its benefit in improving workflow efficiency. The video emphasizes how this seemingly minor feature significantly enhances usability. Finally, the presenter concludes the tutorial, inviting viewers to continue exploring Maverick Render.

## F.A.Q.

- **What is the "Lock Selection" feature in Maverick Render?**
The "Lock Selection" feature in Maverick Render is a tool that allows users to maintain an active selection of an object, preventing accidental deselection. Once an object is locked, it remains selected, regardless of mouse clicks or interactions with other objects in the scene, unless a new selection is made through the scene explorer panels. This feature helps to streamline workflows and makes moving and modifying objects easier.

- **When is the "Lock Selection" feature most useful?**
This feature is especially useful when working with small or hard-to-select objects, like small lights, especially within the ambience composer. It also proves advantageous when multiple objects overlap, as it prevents accidental selection of foreground objects instead of the desired background object. This feature can dramatically improve usability when precise selection is required.

- **How do you use the "Lock Selection" feature in Maverick Render?**
First, you select the object you want to lock. Then, you activate the "Lock Selection" option within the Maverick Render interface. Once locked, the selected object remains the active selection, regardless of further clicks within the viewport. To change your selection when a lock is active, you must make a new selection using the scene explorer panel.

- **How does "Lock Selection" improve working with lights in the ambience composer?**
Lights, especially hard spotlights, often have small selection areas. Without "Lock Selection," it can be challenging to select and move these lights precisely within the ambience composer. By locking the light's selection, you can move it around without worrying about accidentally losing the selection and having to re-select it multiple times.

- **What happens if multiple light objects overlap?**
When multiple light objects overlap, it can be difficult to select a light that is behind another. The "Lock Selection" feature allows you to choose the desired light, lock its selection, and then move or modify it without the foreground light interfering.

- **Can I select other objects while an object is locked?**
Yes, but not directly through the 3D viewport. While an object is locked, you can only select new objects by using the scene explorer panel. This ensures that you can make your desired change to your locked object before selecting anything else.

- **Is the "Lock Selection" feature available for all types of objects in Maverick Render?**
While this video specifically mentions lights, particularly in the ambience composer, the "Lock Selection" feature likely works for any selectable object in the scene. The core benefit is to maintain a chosen selection in the face of other visual elements, which means it is useful for all objects which are difficult to click because of size or other visual objects occluding them.

- **Does "Lock Selection" replace the traditional object selection method?**
No, it complements it. It's an optional feature to use when you need to have extra control of selection. If you do not lock a selection, you can select using normal mouse clicks in the scene. If you require the benefits described, then you should lock your selection, and remember to use the scene explorer when you intend to select a different object.
