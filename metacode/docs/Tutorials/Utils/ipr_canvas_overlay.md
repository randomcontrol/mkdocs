## F.A.Q.

- **What is the main visual change to the IPR (Interactive Path Tracer) in the latest Maverick Render release?**
The primary change is that the render and all IPR tools now extend to fill the entire IPR area. A translucent overlay indicates the aspect ratio of the final render, ensuring users always have a clear preview of how the final image will be framed, rather than a crop.

- **How does the IPR handle changes to render resolution?**
Whenever the render resolution is altered, the IPR dynamically adjusts its field of view and the translucent overlay to match the new proportions. This provides an immediate and accurate representation of the final output regardless of resolution changes.

- **How does the new IPR feature impact turntable renders?**
For turntable renders, Maverick Render can display the turntable's specific aspect ratio using a combo box which allows the user to render to the appropriate proportions of a turntable. This feature enhances the accuracy of composing for turntable based renders.

- **How do I control the new visual aids and their appearance?**
The visual aids, including the translucent overlay and the canvas outline, can be toggled on or off via the "Compositing Guides" button. Furthermore, the opacity and color of the translucent canvas overlay are customizable in the preferences dialog, offering control over its visual presence.

- **What is the "canvas overlay", and how does it improve workflow?**
The "canvas overlay" is the translucent overlay mentioned above. Its main benefit is that it allows the IPR tools, such as the move tool, to be active across the entire IPR surface. This is a major upgrade in efficiency since users are not constricted to a smaller portion of the IPR window.

- **What is the purpose of the new floor plane feature?**
The floor plane is a new grid overlay anchored to the origin of the scene. It is designed to assist users in adjusting their viewpoint to align correctly with perspective lines in the background, which is especially useful for photo compositing work.

- **How is the new floor plane configured?**
The floor plane is a simple to use tool, activated via the "guides" button. The user can also easily adjust its size within the preferences dialog, making it adaptable to scenes of various scales.

- **Where are these new IPR features located in the software?**
These new features can be accessed and customized through the compositing guides button and the preferences dialog, making it easy for users to adjust the settings to their liking. The core changes in this latest release, especially regarding the IPR area can be experienced as soon as the release is installed.
