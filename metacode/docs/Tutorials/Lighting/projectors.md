# Projectors

## Summary

This YouTube tutorial from Maverick Render demonstrates new features in the Maverick Studio and Maverick Indie software. The focus is on a new "hard spotlight" light type and an expanded library of projector maps. Users learn to create realistic lighting effects by combining spotlights with various projector map presets, controlling shadow softness and projection size. The tutorial showcases how these tools enhance scene atmosphere and material presentations. Finally, it highlights a new feature that adds lights to the global ambience for dynamic lighting effects.

## F.A.Q.

- **What are projector maps in Maverick Studio and how are they used?**
Projector maps in Maverick Studio, specifically used with the new "hard spotlight" type, allow you to project patterns, shapes, or colors onto your scene. By dragging and dropping a projector map preset onto the light, you're essentially using the light source as a "slide projector", casting the image from the map onto the surfaces in your 3D scene. This allows for the creation of unique lighting effects and dramatic atmospheres, and breaks the monotony of plain lighting.

- **How do Maverick's hard spotlights differ from other light types, and how do they impact shadows?**
Maverick Studio’s new hard spotlights are designed specifically to create hard, focused shadows. The size of the light source directly impacts the softness of the shadows – smaller lights produce harder shadows, and increasing the size softens the shadows. Hard spotlights are ideal for use with projector maps because the crispness of the shadows is better for defined pattern projection.

- **How do I add and manage projector maps in Maverick Studio?**
Projector maps are accessed via the "Projectors" category in Maverick's unified library panel. You can drag and drop these presets directly onto a hard spotlight to activate the projection. Maverick instantly updates the projection, allowing real-time experimentation with various map shapes and colors. The projector is scaled according to the spotlight's beam angle.

- **How can the beam angle of a hard spotlight affect the projector map?**
The beam angle parameter of the hard spotlight controls the width of the light beam. A larger angle results in a wider beam, and a smaller angle creates a narrower beam. This angle also determines the scale of the projector map on the scene objects. A wider beam will scale the map up, whereas a narrow beam scales the map down. By adjusting the beam angle, you effectively control the area where the projection appears.

- **Can I use colored projector maps, and how does this impact my scene?**
Yes, Maverick Studio supports colored projector maps. This expands the creative possibilities, allowing you to add color tints and varied color patterns along with projected shapes. Using colored projector maps in conjunction with different material properties can result in very unique and interesting effects within the scene.

- **What is "clay render" and how can it help me with light setup?**
Clay render is a feature in Maverick Studio's render panel that temporarily replaces all scene materials with a uniform clay-like material. This view is useful when setting up lights, especially when working with projector maps, because it removes material complexity and helps you visualize the overall lighting impact without the distraction of various colors, reflections, or textures. Once the lighting setup is dialed in, you can disable clay render to return to your scene’s full materials.

- **How can I use the "add to ambience" feature with spotlights, and how does this affect my lighting?**
The "add to ambience" feature allows you to incorporate any spotlight into the global lighting of your scene. When a light is added to the ambience, it will rotate along with the environment and other ambience lights. This is good for when you want a light to act as a more general source rather than a directional source that stays fixed within the scene.

- **Can I duplicate a spotlight with its projector map for complex effects?**
Yes, you can duplicate a spotlight including its assigned projector map using the duplicate light icon. Each clone can then be positioned and adjusted independently and given a different projector map, enabling you to rapidly build complex and layered lighting effects across your scene. This is useful for adding complexity and depth to your renderings quickly.
