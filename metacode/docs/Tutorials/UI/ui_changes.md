## F.A.Q.

- **What is the most significant change to the Maverick render interface in this new version?**
The most significant change is the consolidation of all Maverick libraries into a single, unified panel. This panel now houses categories such as shading, lighting, objects, and favorites, each organized with its own subfolders. For example, the shading library has separate folders for materials, maps, and colors, and the lighting library contains folders for ambiences, environments, backplates, and projectors. This centralized approach aims to streamline the workflow and improve user accessibility.

- **How does the new version improve productivity within the render window?**
The new version introduces a series of shortcut tools located in the bottom left corner of the render window. These shortcuts allow you to quickly load specific parameters into the attributes panel. There are shortcuts to load the selected object, its material parameters, camera settings, the environment and backplate parameters, and the floor shadow catcher material. This direct access reduces the need to navigate through menus, enhancing speed and efficiency.

- **What are the enhancements to the render window's visual aids?**
The render window has been enhanced with several new visual aids. An info tag in the top left corner allows you to monitor various engine parameters. A View sphere in the top right corner provides camera rotation functionality and allows you to easily align the camera to the front, back, left, or right views. There is also a button to return to the saved camera position. In the bottom right corner, a quick help guide displays usage guidelines for the currently selected tool, providing context-sensitive assistance.

- **What is the purpose of the new banner that appears when using a tool?**
When using any tool other than the selection tool, a banner appears as a reminder that the current tool may need to be disabled after use. This banner serves as a visual cue to prevent unintended actions and workflow errors. Clicking the banner immediately exits the current tool and switches back to the selection tool, ensuring a smooth and deliberate user experience.

- **Where is the layouts button now located and what does it do?**
The layouts button, previously located in the main toolbar, is now part of the render window. This button allows users to employ shaded views to position lights or objects without altering the current render window camera position, providing more flexibility in setting up scenes.

- **How has the main toolbar been improved?**
The main toolbar now displays the name of each icon's function. This enhancement makes it easier to identify the purpose of each button, particularly for new users, improving overall ease of use and reducing the learning curve.

- **How does the new help panel function?**
A new, default help panel has been introduced that displays a minimized version of the Maverick documentation relevant to the selected object, light, material, or map in the scene. The help panel provides detailed information on every node without the user having to leave the interface. Additionally, clicking on the main toolbar's help icon displays shortcuts and general usage information.

- **How has the new update addressed the "expert mode" toggle?**
The expert mode toggle is no longer available. Instead, attributes rollouts for advanced features are now collapsed by default. This makes accessing advanced parameters easier by simply expanding relevant sections, which removes the need to switch between expert and regular modes for every node and ensures that complex options remain accessible while keeping the default UI less cluttered.
