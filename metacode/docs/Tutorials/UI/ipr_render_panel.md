# IPR and Render Panel

## Summary

This YouTube video tutorial introduces new features in the Maverick Render software. Key updates include a revamped interactive progressive render (IPR) window with improved responsiveness and navigation tools, a new render panel offering precise resolution control and print-friendly attributes, and a "blow-up" tool for high-resolution inspection of specific render areas. The tutorial demonstrates how to use these features to manage render settings, optimize image quality, and efficiently create final renders. The video also highlights integration with NVIDIA AI denoising.

## F.A.Q.

- **What is the IPR (Interactive Progressive Render) in Maverick Render and how has it been improved?**
The IPR is an interactive window that provides a real-time preview of your scene as you make changes. In the latest Maverick release, the IPR now runs permanently in "ultra-fast" mode, offering much greater responsiveness. It includes navigation tools (pan, zoom), a navigation cube, IPR tools for object selection and movement, a toggle for the NVIDIA AI denoiser, and a snapshot button. Essentially, it provides a highly responsive and versatile real-time preview.

- **What are the primary new features found within the new Render Panel?**
The new render panel offers significantly enhanced controls over render resolution. You can now specify resolution not only in pixels but also in print-friendly units such as centimeters, millimeters, and inches. The IPR dynamically adjusts to any aspect ratio changes, especially when "keep aspect" is enabled, from still frame settings in the globals panel. Additionally, you can easily save cameras, define output settings (including file format and location) and perform draft or full-resolution renders.

- **How does the "keep aspect" setting affect the IPR and render resolutions?**
The "keep aspect" setting ensures that as you adjust the render resolution in the render panel, the IPR will automatically adjust its aspect ratio to match. This prevents distortion and guarantees that your previews and final renders maintain the correct proportions. This setting is particularly useful when switching between different print sizes and display resolutions.

- **What is the purpose of the "draft render" option and how does it differ from the "final render" option?**
The "draft render" option is designed for quick previews and validation of your scene setup. It produces a render at half the resolution specified in the render settings, significantly reducing rendering time. "Final render," on the other hand, produces a full-resolution image, resulting in a higher quality output but at the cost of longer rendering times.

- **Do users need to wait for the render process to completely finish?**
No, users are not required to wait for the render to completely finish. Maverick allows you to stop the rendering process and save the image as soon as you are satisfied with its quality. This means you can quickly iterate and refine your scenes without waiting for unnecessary render time.

- **How does the NVIDIA AI Denoiser integrate with the new IPR and render workflow?**
The NVIDIA AI denoiser can be directly toggled on or off from the IPR window, offering quick access to a tool that can significantly improve image quality. Similarly, you can use the denoiser for a final render from the output settings. This integration streamlines workflow allowing for cleaner, noise-free renders in less time.

- **What is the new "blow up tool" and how is it used?**
The "blow up tool" allows you to zoom in and pan across the rendered image within the IPR without modifying the camera position or scene settings. This is an extremely fast method to examine specific areas of the render frame at an extremely high resolution, allowing for close inspection of detail and quality. This feature enables users to confidently initiate final renders after meticulous inspection.

- **How do these new features contribute to streamlining the rendering process in Maverick?**
The newest version of Maverick streamlines the way you manage interactive resolution, render resolution, and final render settings. Features like the ultra-fast IPR, print-friendly resolution settings, the NVIDIA AI denoiser integration, the draft render option, and the blow-up tool allows for rapid iteration, efficient refinement, and more precise control. In summary, Maverick has focused on making rendering faster, more precise, and more user-friendly.
