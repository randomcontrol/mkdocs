# UI and Layouts

## Summary

This YouTube video tutorial introduces the user interface (UI) of the Maverick Render software. The video explains the different panels and windows, such as the object panel, materials library, and attribute editor, detailing their functions and how they interact. Four pre-set UI layouts are described, offering various configurations optimized for different workflows (full, materials, lighting, and basic). Keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation and layout switching are also highlighted, ultimately aiming to improve user productivity within the rendering software. The tutorial promises future videos exploring each panel in greater depth.

## F.A.Q.

- **What is the IPR in Maverick Render, and how does it relate to the other panels?**
The IPR (Interactive Photorealistic Renderer) is the central window in Maverick where the rendering takes place. It's the primary visual output for your scene. Surrounding the IPR are various panels that provide tools and controls for managing the scene. These include panels for objects, libraries, lights, materials, the nodal editor, and the attribute editor, all of which work together to allow you to create, modify and preview your scene. The panels control different aspects of the render shown in the IPR window.

- **What are Maverick's main panels and what functions do they serve?**
Maverick is organized into several key panels:

    Objects: Displays the cameras and different parts within the scene, allowing you to select and locate items easily.

    Library: Contains a default library with assets and scene setups to get started quickly.

    Lights: Includes environment settings, light sources, and access to over 200 HDRs for lighting your scenes.

    Materials: Displays materials present in your current scene, including their associated maps, and gives you access to a library of over 1500 materials.

    Nodal Editor: A panel under the IPR used to create materials with a more complex system of nodes.

    Attribute Editor: Shows the properties of any selected object, material, camera, or light, allowing you to modify them.

    Counters: Shows the graphic cards that are installed.

    Console: Displays error messages from the developer or user.

    Tone Map: Provides tools for post-production of Maverick renders, including various options for fine-tuning the output.

    Light Mixer: Allows you to edit the intensity and color of different lights in the scene without re-rendering.

    A/B: Stores your render history where you can save and compare renders.

    AOVs: Provides access to typical Arbitrary Output Variables for use in compositing.

- **How do I manage the Maverick user interface layout?**
Maverick allows you to freely move, resize, close, and rearrange its panels to suit your workflow. It also has pre-configured layouts accessible through shortcuts:

    Full Layout (F1): Displays all active panels, for standard work.

    Materials Layout (F2): Highlights the nodal editor and material-related panels.

    Lighting Layout (F3): Focuses on lighting tools and introduces shaded view windows.

    Basic Layout (F4): Designed for working with the library through drag and drop. You can switch between these layouts using the F1-F4 keys, but you are also able to move panels and create your own setups. Maverick's default configurations are recommended as they have been optimized for performance.

- **What are shaded views, and how are they different from the IPR?**
Shaded views are additional windows within Maverick used for scene manipulation and lighting setup. Unlike the IPR which shows the fully rendered output, shaded views display a simplified scene representation. This allows you to move items and cameras in real time without affecting the rendering in the IPR. It also facilitates the addition and adjustment of lighting. Shaded views can be configured through the main toolbar or via the layout menu.

- **How can I optimize my work in Maverick using shortcuts?**
Maverick has many shortcuts, but some key ones to utilize include:

    F1, F2, F3, and F4: Change between the pre-configured layouts (Full, Materials, Lighting, and Basic)

    Ctrl + Tab: Toggles full-screen IPR, hiding all other panels. When in full-screen, clicking on any item will bring up the Attribute Editor. Pressing Ctrl+Tab once more will return to the original layout. Becoming familiar with these shortcuts will speed up your workflow.

- **How can I manage materials in Maverick?**
Maverick offers multiple ways to manage materials. You can:

    Browse the materials that are already in your current scene through the 'Materials' panel.

    Access the "Materials Library" which contains over 1500 materials. You can drag and drop these to your scene.

    Create and modify complex materials using the 'Nodal Editor', which is found under the IPR.

    Use the "Attribute Editor" to modify properties of selected materials or objects which includes materials.

- **What tools does Maverick provide for lighting my scene?**
Maverick provides a comprehensive suite of tools for lighting:

    Lighting Panel: Gives access to environment settings, light sources and over 200 HDRIs.

    Shaded Views: Allow for the manipulation of lights in real-time.

    Light Mixer: Enables you to edit the color and intensity of individual lights without needing to re-render your scene. This is useful for fine-tuning the look and feel of your lighting.

- **How does Maverick facilitate post-production and rendering output management?**
Maverick has two key tools for post-production and render management:

    Tone Map Panel: Used for adjustments to the rendered output and to apply post-processing effects.

    A/B Panel: Stores render history, allowing you to save and compare different versions of your renders. Additionally, Maverick provides Arbitrary Output Variables (AOVs) for advanced compositing workflows.
