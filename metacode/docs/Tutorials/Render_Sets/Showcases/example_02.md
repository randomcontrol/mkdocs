## Summary

This YouTube tutorial demonstrates the "render sets" feature in Maverick Render software. The video uses a sample scene to show how to configure output settings, enabling users to render objects separately as layers in a PSD or PNG file. The tutorial highlights the benefits of organized scene structures and demonstrates how to assign unique IDs to objects for individual rendering and compositing in Photoshop. It also explains how to override inherited settings for specific objects to achieve customized rendering results. Finally, the presenter promises more examples in future videos.

## F.A.Q.

- **What are render sets in Maverick Render, and why are they useful?**
Render sets in Maverick Render allow you to render individual objects or groups of objects in your scene separately. This is extremely useful for compositing and post-processing because it lets you adjust specific elements in an image without affecting the rest of the scene. By isolating objects into separate layers, you gain flexibility in color correction, adding effects, or even making material changes post-render. This saves time compared to re-rendering the entire scene every time you want a change.

- **How do you enable render sets in Maverick Render?**
You enable render sets in the render panel. First, you select a file format for your output, such as PSD or PNG. Then you activate the 'render sets' option. You also may need to configure backdrop settings based on whether your scene includes a backdrop. In the case of a scene with no backdrop you might then disable options pertaining to the backdrop. You can also specify the inclusion of the background as a separate layer.

- **What is the significance of organizing your scene in Maverick Render when working with render sets?**
Organizing your scene with parent groups is highly recommended for effective use of render sets. A well-organized scene makes it easier to assign IDs to different parts of the scene, which allows you to render these parts separately. The use of parent groups allows you to use the auto-assign ids function. This function automatically assigns incrementing ids to each parent group and object.

- **What are auto-assigned IDs in the context of render sets?**
Auto-assigned IDs are automatically generated unique identifiers that Maverick Render assigns to objects and groups in your scene. Using the 'auto-assign IDs' action, each parent group and object receives a unique numeric identifier. These IDs are crucial when creating render sets because they allow you to specify which objects to include in which separate render output. You can choose to auto assign ids per object or per material, depending on your needs.

- **How do you specify which objects to render in a particular render set?**
You can specify the objects to render by referring to their IDs in the render sets list. You might enter the keyword "all" to render all objects that have IDs, or a specific numerical ID to only include an object with that ID. This allows you to render objects, or groups, separately by simply referencing their assigned ID. You would specify these IDs within the render panel after enabling the render sets option.

- **What is the purpose of disabling "inherit from parent" for an object in a nested group?**
When an object is nested within a group, it usually inherits the render settings of that parent group, by default. However, if you wish to give a specific nested object a unique render set and compositing settings that differ from the parent group, you must disable the "inherit from parent" option for that object. Once you disable this option, you can specify the object's own unique ID, and control its render output independant from its parent group.

- **What are some of the output formats Maverick Render offers when rendering with render sets, and why would you choose one over the other?**
Maverick Render supports several output formats for render sets, such as PSD and PNG. PSD format preserves layers and groups generated by the render sets, making it convenient to open up the file in compositing software such as photoshop, with each object or group appearing in its own layer. PNG format allows you to use an embedded alpha channel which is useful when compositing as it renders the object with transparency making it easy to layer it over existing images. You might choose PSD when you want to work with the rendered elements within groups, and choose PNG when you require transparency.

- **How can you verify that render sets are working correctly?**
After creating a render set, use the draft rendering option as a fast way to get a preview. Once rendered, verify that individual objects are detached from the rest of the scene and that they are indeed rendered as separate elements. For example, you might overlay a PNG render with embedded alpha over another render of the same scene to see if they fit correctly within your final composition. You can also use photoshop to verify that a PSD rendering has the objects on their own separate layers.
