## F.A.Q.

- **What is Maverick Indie and who is it designed for?**
Maverick Indie is a software tool focused on enabling artists to create impressive images from their 3D models. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, providing a streamlined workflow for artists of varying skill levels, particularly those working with textured 3D assets.

- **How does Maverick Indie facilitate importing models from Substance Painter?**
Maverick Indie offers a simple import process specifically designed for assets textured in Substance Painter. Users export their textures and .obj mesh from Substance Painter using a provided preset, then in Maverick Indie they use the "Substance Painter import button," to load the .obj file. Maverick automatically gathers the associated texture files, sets up the materials, and organizes the scene based on the texture sets defined in Substance Painter, significantly reducing setup time.

- **What are some key features of Maverick Indie’s material and lighting systems?**
Maverick Indie boasts a PBR (Physically Based Rendering) standard material system, which automatically sets up materials upon import from Substance Painter. It includes a vast library of preset ambiences with HDR environments and back plates for quick lighting setup. Users can create custom area lights and a light mixer allows for real-time lighting adjustments, including color and intensity, without needing to restart the render. The light mixer changes can also be baked into the scene.

- **How are the imported models organized in Maverick Indie after import?**
Upon import, Maverick Indie creates groups for each material, properly naming and ordering objects based on the texture sets from Substance Painter. This keeps the scene organized and reflects the original structure from Substance Painter. The materials panel shows each material and texture that was imported with auto-setup using Mavericks PBR standard material.

- **Does Maverick Indie support real time scene editing and rendering?**
Yes, Maverick Indie is designed for efficient rendering and real-time scene editing. The software offers an "ultra-fast" render preset with denoiser capabilities which significantly improves preview speed. This allows artists to concentrate on adjusting scene elements such as lighting and camera effects and receive immediate feedback, without extended render waiting times.

- **How do the built in Ambiences in Maverick Indie work, and can I use custom lighting environments?**
Maverick Indie comes with over 28 preset ambiences and many more HDR environment libraries. These ambiences are quick lighting presets with a shadow-catching floor, offering immediate visual impact. Additionally, the software allows users to create custom lights and import custom HDR environments for more personalized lighting setups.

- **Can changes made in Substance Painter be easily updated in Maverick Indie?**
Yes, Maverick Indie supports a seamless iterative workflow with Substance Painter. When textures are modified in Substance Painter and re-exported, users can simply use Maverick Indie’s "reload all Maps" button to update the materials and textures in their scene. There is no need to re-import and configure the scene, allowing artists to make quick revisions and see them reflected instantly in their Maverick Indie scene.

- **Does Maverick Indie offer camera effects and photographic controls, like depth of field?**
Yes, Maverick Indie offers photographic controls, including a very fast depth of field. Users can adjust the camera's aperture (f-stop) to control the amount of defocusing and lock the exposure. Autofocus allows for easy focus on specific parts of the scene, just like a real camera. These features add a touch of realism and cinematic quality to the rendered images with minimal impact on rendering time.
