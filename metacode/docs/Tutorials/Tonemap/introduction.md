# Introduction

## Summary

This YouTube video tutorial demonstrates Maverick Render's tone mapping and A/B comparator tools. The tone mapping panel offers real-time adjustments for image color, contrast, and brightness, including presets and granular controls over shadows, highlights, and mid-tones. The A/B comparator allows users to take snapshots of renders, compare them side-by-side, and save their work. The video covers a wide range of features, showcasing how these tools streamline the post-production process. The tutorial uses a headphone scene example to illustrate these functions.

## F.A.Q.

- **What is tone mapping in Maverick Render, and why is it important?**
Tone mapping in Maverick Render is a post-production tool built directly into the software. It allows you to control the final look of your rendered image in real-time without requiring re-renders. It's important because it gives you precise control over brightness, contrast, color, and other factors, saving significant time in post-processing workflows. Tone mapping essentially allows you to adjust how the render's luminance is mapped to displayable values.

- **What kind of presets are available in the tone mapping panel, and what do they do?**
The tone mapping panel offers several presets. These include "Black and White" which removes color saturation, "Default" which resets all parameters to their defaults, "High Contrast" which adds punch to images, "Low Contrast" which is ideal for more post-production latitude, and "Post Pro" which are examples of custom parameters saved as presets. These presets provide a quick way to establish a particular mood or starting point for image adjustments.

- **How can I adjust the brightness of my render using the tone mapping panel?**
You can control the brightness of your render using the "Exposure" slider in the tone mapping panel. This works similarly to adjusting the camera's f-stop or shutter speed but does so in real-time, instantly affecting the image.

- **What is the purpose of the "Burn" parameter in tone mapping?**
The "Burn" parameter helps prevent highlights from becoming completely white (or "burned out"), thus preserving detail in the brightest parts of the image. Using it carefully can help you to retain highlight details, creating a more realistic and pleasing image. However, using too low values can give the image an unnatural look.

- **How do the "Curves" parameters in tone mapping help control the image?**
The "Curves" parameters offer a powerful way to radically change an image by allowing control over contrast, shadows, blacks, whites, highlights, and mid-tones. These controls function similarly to their counterparts in photo editing software, enabling the precise manipulation of tonal ranges within the render. The shadows slider allows you to lighten or darken the less illuminated parts of your render, the blacks and white sliders allow you to control the luminance values where pixels are clipped to full black and white respectively.

- **How does the "Vibrance" slider differ from the "Saturation" slider in the tone mapping panel?**
While the "Saturation" slider affects all pixels equally, the "Vibrance" slider works more selectively. Vibrance primarily boosts colors with low saturation while leaving already saturated colors mostly untouched. This allows for a more nuanced color enhancement without making the image look over saturated.

- **What is the purpose of the A/B comparator in Maverick Render, and how can it be used effectively?**
The A/B comparator allows you to take snapshots of your renders and then compare them side-by-side using a draggable splitter. This makes it easy to assess different adjustments, such as tone mapping changes or scene edits, and decide which approach yields the best results. You can save and load these snapshots to review your progress and choices later.

- **How can the hot pixel removal tool help with the quality of renders in Maverick?**
The hot pixel removal tool is extremely useful when a scene produces fireflies or isolated bright pixels. By enabling this tool, the tool instantly removes these sparse bright noise artifacts, giving you a much cleaner, more polished final render.
