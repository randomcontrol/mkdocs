# Python and Batch Rendering

## Summary

This YouTube video tutorial demonstrates how to use Python scripting within the Maverick Render software for batch rendering. The tutorial highlights pre-written scripts for automating tasks like rendering all cameras in a scene or all scenes in a directory. Users are shown how to configure settings such as resolution, output file names, and denoising. The video also encourages viewers to explore additional technical details on the Maverick Render blog and to request custom scripts. The overall focus is on simplifying repetitive rendering workflows through Python automation.

## F.A.Q.

- **What is the primary benefit of using Python scripting in Maverick Render?**
Python scripting in Maverick Render allows users to automate repetitive tasks, specifically focusing on batch rendering. This eliminates the need to use command-line tools like Render Warrior for multi-render jobs and streamlines the workflow by allowing users to create custom automation macros.

- **How can I access and utilize the pre-made Python scripts within Maverick Render?**
The pre-made Python scripts are located in the Python panel within Maverick Render. Users can browse the list of scripts, which have self-explanatory names, and select the script that fits their needs, such as rendering all cameras in a scene or rendering all scenes in a directory.

- **How does the "Render all cameras in the current scene" script work?**
This script iterates through all the cameras present in the active scene, rendering each one sequentially. Before execution, the user can configure parameters like resolution, output file name, denoising, and target sample level (SL). Upon completion, the script automatically creates a separate subfolder for each camera's output, keeping the rendered images organized.

- **How does the "Render all scenes in a directory" script function?**
This script renders all .mks files located in a user-specified directory. It renders the active camera in each of the scene files, one after the other. Before running the script, the user must set a variable at the beginning of the script to indicate the directory containing the .mks files.

- **What kind of customization is possible with the pre-made scripts?**
While the pre-made scripts provide a ready-to-use starting point, users have flexibility in configuring parameters, such as resolution, output paths, denoising options and target sample levels. Furthermore, the directory path for rendering multiple scenes can be specified for each user.

- **Where can I find more in-depth technical details about the Python integration in Maverick Render?**
More in-depth technical information about the Python integration within Maverick Render can be found on the Maverick Render blog. This resource can help users optimize their use of scripting capabilities.

- **Can users request custom Python scripts for their specific project needs?**
Yes, users can reach out to the Maverick Render team to request the creation of custom bespoke scripts for their projects, should they need scripts tailored to their unique tasks or workflow. This provides a path for custom tailored solutions.

- **How do I run a selected script?**
After selecting and configuring the desired script in the Python panel, simply press the play button to execute the script. The rendering process will start, and you will be able to view the output upon completion.
