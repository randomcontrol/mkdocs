## **pro_float_profile**

This gradient-type node provides an evaluable curve that is typically used as input to other programming nodes such as float_remap. Besides an editable gradient, this node offers a collection of handy easing curve presets.

#### Main

> ##### Curve easing
> Defines the speed curve at which the motion happens at the beginning (in) or end (out) of the motion controller's duration. Easing helps produce transitions between consecutive motion controller blocks that look easier on the eyes.

> ##### Easing strength
> .

> ##### Profile gradient
> Editable profile curve.

> ##### Curve repeat
> .

> ##### Curve ping-pong
> .

#### Output tuning

> ##### Value weight
> The final value output by the node is, actually: value*weight+bias.

> ##### Value bias
> The final value output by the node is, actually: value*weight+bias.
