## **pro_float_math**

This node performs an algebraic operation between two given programming nodes. The result of the operation is always an floating-point scalar value.
#### Common

> ##### Node alias
> Human-readable node alias.

> ##### Alias color
> Identificative node color.

> ##### Node UUID
> Node UUID.

> ##### Node metadata
> User-set node metadata.

> ##### Node tags
> User-set node tags.

#### Main

> ##### Operator
> Selects the operation to be performed between both operands. Note that input data types may be upcast if necessary.

> ##### A operand
> Operation's first operand, when no input programming node is provided.

> ##### A operand node
> Operation's first operand.

> ##### B operand
> Operation's second operand, when no input programming node is provided.

> ##### B operand node
> Operation's second operand.

#### Output tuning

> ##### Value weight
> The final value output by the node is, actually: value*weight+bias.

> ##### Value bias
> The final value output by the node is, actually: value*weight+bias.
