`Python: "map_cellular"`

This node encapsulates the classic Worley noise algorithm. Worley noise randomly fills space cells with singular points used to anchor visual features. This type of map is ideal to simulate granular surfaces (e.g., leather, snake skin, ...).

## Common

Identificative node color.

#### Swap colors
`Python: "map_color_swap"`

Defines the primary (background) color. The lower end of the output signal range is remapped to this color.

#### Primary color map
`Python: "map_color_1_map"`

Defines the primary color using a texture map.

#### Secondary color
`Python: "map_color_2"`

## Main

#### Metric
`Python: "map_noise_metric"`

Defines how the features (i.e., points) in the noise field are interpreted. Each mode produces a characteristic look.

#### Mode
`Python: "map_noise_mode"`

Defines how homogeneously or heterogeneously the noise octaves stack on top of each other.

#### Signal
`Python: "map_noise_signal"`

Defines the remapping performed on the raw noise signal at each octave.

#### Octaves

Number of times the noise algorithm overlaps onto itself to add higher frequency details. Be aware that a high number of octaves is taxing on performance.

#### Decay

#### Repeat U
`Python: "map_xform_repeat_x"`

Repeats the map along the X/U axis. Increasing this value increases repetition.

#### Enable U repetition
`Python: "map_xform_tile_x"`

Allows map repetition along the X/U axis. When disallowed, the map becomes zero outside the [0..1] (or cropped) X/U interval.

#### Clamp vs. repeat (U)
`Python: "map_xform_clamp_x"`

Toggles between clamped vs. repeated output outside the [0..1] (or cropped) X/U interval.

#### Repeat V
`Python: "map_xform_repeat_y"`

Repeats the map along the Y/V axis. Increasing this value increases repetition.

#### Clamp vs. repeat (W)

Amount of noise distortion applied to the UVs before they are used.

`Python: "map_distortion_blur"`

Amount of 2D gaussian (jittering) blur applied to the UVs before they are used. This value is given in UVW space. Note that this type of blur may cause sampling noise that takes long to dissolve.
