## **blend**

With the blend material one can create compound materials. Compound materials can be alloys, where each submaterial contributes a percentage to the total, or mask-based blends where one or more mask maps determine which parts of the object reveal which submaterial.
#### Main

> ##### Node alias
> Human-readable node alias.

> ##### Alias color
> Identificative node color.

> ##### Node UUID
> Node UUID.

> ##### Node metadata
> User-set node metadata.

> ##### Node tags
> User-set node tags.

#### UV mapping

> ##### Projection mode
> Defines the UVW mapping projection mode.

> ##### Override uvmap
> Uses the inner material UVW mapping controls, overriding the uvmap modifier(s) of the host object, if any.

> ##### Triplanar blend
> If the projection is triplanar, defines how much the three planar projections are blended onto each other.

> ##### Width
> Real world size of the material along the X axis.

> ##### Height
> Real world size of the material along the Y axis.

> ##### Depth
> Real world size of the material along the Z axis.

> ##### Real size link
> Links the three real world dimensions so they are edited together.

> ##### Width repeat
> Repeats (i.e., tiles) the UVW mapping along the X axis the given number of times within the defined width.

> ##### Height repeat
> Repeats (i.e., tiles) the UVW mapping along the Y axis the given number of times within the defined height.

> ##### Depth repeat
> Repeats (i.e., tiles) the UVW mapping along the Z axis the given number of times within the defined depth.

> ##### Repeat link
> Links the three real size repeat values so they are edited together.

> ##### Axis alignment
> Reorients the projection towards the selected axis.

> ##### Convert to uvmap modifier
> Creates a uvmap modifier node and transfers the material's UVW mapping attributes. The new uvmap node is applied to the host object.

> ##### Repeat X
> Repeats the projected UVW space along the X/U axis. Increasing this value increases repetition.

> ##### Repeat Y
> Repeats the projected UVW space along the Y/V axis. Increasing this value increases repetition.

> ##### Translate X
> Offsets the projected UVW space along the X/U axis.

> ##### Translate Y
> Offsets the projected UVW space along the Y/V axis.

> ##### Rotate
> Rotates the projected UVW space about the Z/W axis. Positive values rotate counter-clockwise.

#### Submaterials

> ##### Additive
> Changes the blending mode to Additive.

> ##### Material
> Defines the base material. Blend materials can be nested to extend the maximum number of blended materials.

> ##### Material weight
> Blend amount for the base material.

> ##### Material weight map
> Grayscale texture map which luminance controls the blend amount for the base material.

> ##### Material
> Defines the i-th material layer. Additional layers are stacked on top of the base material.

> ##### Material weight
> Blend amount for the i-th material layer.

> ##### Material weight map
> Grayscale texture map which luminance controls the blend amount for the i-th material layer.

> ##### Material
> Defines the i-th material layer. Additional layers are stacked on top of the base material.

> ##### Material weight
> Blend amount for the i-th material layer.

> ##### Material weight map
> Grayscale texture map which luminance controls the blend amount for the i-th material layer.

> ##### Material
> Defines the i-th material layer. Additional layers are stacked on top of the base material.

> ##### Material weight
> Blend amount for the i-th material layer.

> ##### Material weight map
> Grayscale texture map which luminance controls the blend amount for the i-th material layer.

#### Displacement

> ##### Enable displacement
> Enables displacement mapping in the object the material is applied to.

> ##### Displacement height
> Determines, in real units, how much the height map will push geometry vertices during displacement.

> ##### Displacement height map
> Sets the displacement height texture map. This map gets multiplied by the height value.

> ##### Adaptive displacement
> Makes the subdivision process dynamically adapt to the features of both the geometry and the height map, subdividing more in areas where displacement varies rapidly and less in simpler areas. This feature conserves memory and render time.

#### Micro-Polygon Displacement

> ##### Enable MPDM
> Internal use.

> ##### MPDM height
> Internal use.

> ##### MPDM height map
> Internal use.

#### Opacity

> ##### Enable opacity
> Enables opacity mapping in the geometry the material is applied to. Note that opacity mapping is computationally-intensive.

> ##### Opacity
> Defines the percentage of light rays that will be allowed to pass through the object not being affected by it in any way.

> ##### Opacity map
> Defines the opacity level of the object with a grayscale texture map. Opacity maps are interpreted so dark colors make the surface more translucent; i.e., black completely clips the geometry away, whereas white produces fully solid geometry. This map gets multiplied by the numerical opacity value.

> ##### Single-sided geometry
> When enabled, object(s) this material is applied to will be visible from their front side, but invisible from their back side.
