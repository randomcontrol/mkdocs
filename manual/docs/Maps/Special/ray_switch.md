## **ray_switch**

### The ray_switch map node acts as a fork so light paths arriving at the map will be rewired to another map based on the path type.
#### Main

> ##### Node alias
> Human-readable node alias. 

> ##### Alias color
> Identificative node color. 

> ##### Node UUID
> Node UUID. 

> ##### Node metadata
> User-set node metadata. 

#### Camera

> ##### Enable camera rays override
> Enables the map override for camera rays (i.e., direct vision). 

> ##### Camera rays color override
> Defines what color to use for camera rays (i.e., direct vision). 

> ##### Camera rays map override
> Defines what map to use for camera rays (i.e., direct vision). 

> ##### Camera rays backfacing color override
> Defines what map to use for camera rays (i.e., direct vision) in backfacing surfaces. 

> ##### Camera rays backfacing map override
> Defines what map to use for camera rays (i.e., direct vision) in backfacing surfaces. 

> ##### Enable camera rays backfacing override
> Enables the map override for camera rays (i.e., direct vision) in backfacing surfaces. If this option is not enabled, the front override will be used for both back and front. 

#### Reflection

> ##### Enable reflection color override
> Enables the color override for reflection light paths. 

> ##### Reflection rays color override
> Defines what color to use for reflection light paths. 

> ##### Reflection rays map override
> Defines what map to use for reflection light paths. 

> ##### Reflection rays backfacing color override
> Defines what color to use for reflection light paths in backfacing surfaces. 

> ##### Reflection rays backfacing map override
> Defines what map to use for reflection light paths in backfacing surfaces. 

> ##### Enable reflection rays backfacing color override
> Enables the color override for reflection light paths in backfacing surfaces. If this option is not enabled, the front override will be used for both back and front. 

#### Refraction

> ##### Enable refraction override
> Enables the map override for refraction light paths. 

> ##### Refraction rays color override
> Defines what color to use for refraction light paths. 

> ##### Refraction rays map override
> Defines what map to use for refraction light paths. 

> ##### Refraction rays backfacing color override
> Defines what color to use for refraction light paths in backfacing surfaces. 

> ##### Refraction rays backfacing map override
> Defines what map to use for refraction light paths in backfacing surfaces. 

> ##### Enable refraction rays backfacing override
> Enables the map override for refraction light paths in backfacing surfaces. If this option is not enabled, the front override will be used for both back and front. 

#### Global Illumination

> ##### Enable GI rays override
> Enables the map override to be used as a fallback for paths that are neither reflection/refraction nor camera rays. 

> ##### Camera rays color override
> Defines what color to use as a fallback for paths that are neither reflection/refraction nor camera rays. 

> ##### Camera rays map override
> Defines what map to use as a fallback for paths that are neither reflection/refraction nor camera rays. 

> ##### Camera rays backfacing color override
> Defines what color to use as a fallback for paths that are neither reflection/refraction nor camera rays in backfacing surfaces. 

> ##### Camera rays backfacing map override
> Defines what map to use as a fallback for paths that are neither reflection/refraction nor camera rays in backfacing surfaces. 

> ##### Enable GI rays backfacing override
> Enables the map override to be used as a fallback for paths that are neither reflection/refraction nor camera rays in backfacing surfaces. If this option is not enabled, the front override will be used for both back and front.
